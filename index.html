                    <p>Every year I set out to learn something completely new. One year, that was ice skating - thankfully I escaped with no broken bones. The next, it was violin. I met the world most patient (and talented) violin teacher. The next year, woodworking. This year, programming.</p>
                    <p>Admittedly, this year is slightly less of a stretch. I spend a lot of time around programmers in my role as Product Manager of GitHub Learning Lab and, prior to that, I spent a lot of time teaching programmers how to use Git and GitHub. Prior to that, I taught myself how to "program" in order to create eLearning courses. This isn't completely new to me ... but yet it is.</p>
                    <p>You may ask, why do you spend all this time learning random things? Wouldn't you be better off to stick to one thing? Maybe I would be a better programmer (or violin player or ice skater), but what I get from these learning adventures is a better understanding of the learning process. For example, from my ice skating coach, I learned that if you aren't falling, you aren't trying. And from my violin teacher I learned that exceptional players don't practice everything from beginning to end over - and over - and over. Instead, they focus on a single measure and practice it until they can't get it wrong. Constantly forcing myself to learn new things keeps me in touch with what it's like to be new at something, and when you are a trainer - that's a level of empathy you can't afford to be without.</p>
                    <p>And here I am, learning how to be a full stack web developer in a part time bootcamp -- because I hope it will make me a better project manager and I hope it will give me a lot of insight into what it's like to walk this road. This portfolio will be the collecting point for all the fun things I build along the way. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
